# Teacher_day-challenge (2025)

And so it begins! ðŸš€

I'm thrilled to announce that I'm officially starting the 43 Days Coding Challenge today! This is an amazing initiative by my university, VIT Bhopal, as part of the #TeachersDayChallenge.

For the next 43 days, my goal is simple: solve one coding problem every single day. I'll be tackling the Beginner's Track to build a rock-solid foundation in problem-solving, sharpen my coding skills, and get interview-ready.

Consistency is the goal, and the journey starts now. Wish me luck, and I'll be sharing my weekly progress right here!
